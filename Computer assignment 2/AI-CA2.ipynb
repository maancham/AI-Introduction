    "## Last Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this fitness?\n",
    "<p> Since it is the most obvious one to consider and also requires little time to compute.(About 0.003 seconds for each call). Besides a high score using this algorithm means a nearer answer to the final one </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to choose parents?\n",
    "<p> I used numpy choice library to choose two parents at the beginning of each iteration. This method will get a source list which is population_list, a count which is 2 and finally a list of probabilities that should be the same size as source list. This method is both fast (since it uses numpy) and also all elements can participate in being a parent which is much better that always choosing the top ranking elements.<p/>"
